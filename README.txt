IMPLEMENTATIONS FROM CLASS EXAMPLE:

   ProfileActivity.kt:
    - Implemented code patterns from class example of "CameraDemoKotlin" in order to implement the camera functionality and the uses of permission.
    - No code has been copied and pasted. All code used have been referenced from the example shown in class but then built in my own way of coding.
    - All other functionalities have been developed by me!

   AppUtil.kt:
     - Implemented and built upon from class example "CameraDemoKotlin" to make ProfileActivity.kt work properly
     - checkPermissions() was implemented from class example but built upon to add more features.
     - loadBitmapFromUri() was built on top of the implementation from class example and added the rotate functionality.

   MyViewModel.kt:
     - Implemented from class example "CameraDemoKotlin" to make ProfileActivity.kt work properly.

   AndroidManifest.xml:
     - Built upon the file provider example that was shared in class and through "CameraDemoKotlin"

Every other aspect of the lab was implemented and developed by me!
